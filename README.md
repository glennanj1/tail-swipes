# Tail Swipes 

Welcome! This is my animal socialization app that uses create-react-app, redux and thunk. A mock user is able to swipe left and right on animal profiles. If the mock user matches with a profile said user is able to message back and forth. This was one of my most challenging projects but I have it up and running on https://tailswipes.netlify.app. Please check it out and feel free to contribute. I would be glad to review pull requests to make this app better. I want to incorporate a landing page, login system and a merchandise store.  

# Install Instructions

First head over to my tail-swipes backend clone and bundle. Then create, migrate and seed the database. Next start up rails server so you have some back end data to play with. Now for the front end use npm i && npm start. After installing the packages and starting the react server the only other dependency is google maps api key which is required to use the google place park finder.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
